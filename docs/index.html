      <h3>TinyCMS 1.4 Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks for downloading TinyCMS 1.4, we hope you enjoy it.
      </p>

      <h3>Installing TinyCMS</h3>
      <p>
        To install TinyCMS, upload the files to your server and you're ready to roll. Visit <strong>YourSite.com/admin/</strong> and use the default login details. The default username is <strong>admin</strong>
        and the default password is <strong>pass</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Installing themes/templates</h3>
      <p>
        At this time, we're still creating a great guide for themes. Sadly, we had to push the 1.4 update so we didn't get around to
        improving the templates. Check out our <a href="http://tinycms.net/?page=themes" target="_blank">themes page</a>
        for some starters.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Changes to file locations</h3>
      <p>
        <strong style="color:orange;">Note for existing themes</strong>. In 1.3, we moved the JS files from yoursite.com/js to yoursite.com/admin/js to clean up the directories. If you're using a theme from our website,
        ensure the directories are correct or the site may not work correctly.
      </p>

      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>
        TinyCMS 1.4 includes a new feature, drafts! Save your pages without publishing them so you don't have to worry about them going live before they're ready.
